#About

Simply put, a facade encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface. It hides much of the complexity and makes the subsystem easy to use.

Also, if we need to use the complex subsystem directly, we still can do that; we aren't forced to use the facade all the time.


Besides a much simpler interface, there's one more benefit of using this design pattern. It decouples a client implementation from the complex subsystem. Thanks to this, we can make changes to the existing subsystem and don't affect a client.
